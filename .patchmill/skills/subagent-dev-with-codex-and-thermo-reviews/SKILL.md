# Patchmill Subagent Dev with Codex and Thermo Reviews

Execute the implementation plan with Superpowers' subagent-driven-development
pattern, then close the work with Codex, thermo-nuclear, and final
validation-readiness review before landing.

**Core principle:** task-level reviews catch local issues; final full-worktree
reviews and final validation readiness catch integration, regression,
structural, and known command failures before Patchmill lands or opens a PR.

## Required sub-skills and agents

- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use the installed sibling Superpowers
  subagent-driven-development skill for task-by-task plan execution. Read it
  from `../subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md` and read its prompt templates
  from `../subagent-driven-development/` before dispatching task-level
  subagents.
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
  before claiming success.
- Use Pi `subagent` with the canonical `reviewer` agent for both final code
  review passes and the final validation-readiness review.
- Use Pi `subagent` with `worker` to fix accepted final-review findings, final
  validation findings, and code-related failed PR checks.
- Do **not** use legacy `code-reviewer`; in Pi, it is a disabled compatibility
  shim.

Before launching any subagent, list available agents with
`subagent({ action: "list" })` and confirm `reviewer` and `worker` are
executable.

## Non-interactive Patchmill orchestration

Patchmill runs this skill inside a one-turn, non-interactive `pi -p` invocation.
Preserve the configured worker and reviewer topology, including multiple
sequential or parallel runs, while keeping lifecycle ownership in the parent
agent.

- Track every foreground or background subagent run until it reaches a terminal
  state.
- Use `subagent({ action: "status" })` to inspect active runs, or include an
  `id` to inspect one run.
- Status is inspection, not waiting. Do not repeatedly poll status merely to
  pass time.
- The parent may continue genuinely independent work while background runs are
  active, but it must not advance past a checkpoint that depends on a subagent
  until that run completes and its result is consumed.
- When no independent work remains and a required result is outstanding, call
  `wait({ id })` or `wait({ all: true })` rather than ending the turn.
- Before final handoff, inspect active runs. Any queued, running, paused,
  needs-attention, or otherwise unresolved run prohibits the final response.
- Resolve, await, resume, or interrupt every outstanding run before
  finalization.
- A subagent result is an intermediate workflow checkpoint. Continue through
  every remaining task, review, fix, re-review, validation, PR-check, todo, and
  landing step required by this skill.
- Never return progress prose or promise to continue after the response. This
  non-interactive invocation has no subsequent turn.

## Process

### 1. Execute the implementation plan

Follow the installed sibling Superpowers subagent-driven-development workflow
for all implementation tasks:

1. Fresh implementer/worker per task as directed by that skill.
2. Task-level spec compliance review.
3. Task-level code quality review.
4. Fix and re-review until each task is complete.

Adapt its subagent wording to Pi:

- Dispatch task implementers and fix passes through Pi `worker` unless the task
  is so mechanical that the active project has a more specific worker agent.
- Dispatch task-level spec and code-quality reviews through Pi `reviewer` with
  fresh context.
- If any upstream Superpowers template mentions `superpowers:code-reviewer` or
  `code-reviewer`, replace that role with Pi `reviewer`. Never dispatch legacy
  `code-reviewer`.
- Keep the upstream task-level review order: spec compliance first, code quality
  second.

Do not replace task-level reviews with the final reviews below. Both are
required.

### 2. Capture final implementation scope

After all plan tasks and task-level reviews are complete:

1. Record the implementation base SHA from the Patchmill prompt, plan context,
   or the branch point against the target branch.
2. Record current `HEAD`.
3. Run `git status --short`.
4. Run focused validation required by the plan.
5. Include committed changes, uncommitted changes, and untracked implementation
   files in final review scope.

Refresh this scope snapshot before every final review dispatch and every
re-review dispatch. If a worker fix pass commits or edits files, update current
`HEAD`, `git status --short`, and validation summary before asking the reviewer
to inspect the next version.

If validation fails, fix validation failures before requesting final reviews.

### 3. Run final review pass 1: Codex review

Dispatch a fresh-context, review-only `reviewer` subagent using
`prompts/final-review.md` and Armin Ronacher's Codex review prompt adaptation.

Use:

- `rubrics/armin-codex-review-prompt.md`
- Review name: `Final Codex full-worktree review`
- Scope: the entire final worktree and full implementation diff

The reviewer must not edit files. It must inspect the code directly, cite
file/line evidence, and return a clear verdict.

### 4. Fix Codex-review findings

If the Codex reviewer reports Critical or Important findings, or any Minor
finding that should be fixed before landing:

1. Synthesize accepted findings.
2. Dispatch `worker` using `prompts/fix-review-findings.md`.
3. Instruct the worker to apply only accepted fixes, preserve approved scope,
   and validate.
4. Re-run the Codex final review until it passes or only explicitly deferred
   findings remain.

Ask the human before applying any review item that changes product scope,
architecture beyond the approved plan, public API, migration strategy, or
landing policy.

### 5. Run final review pass 2: Cursor thermo-nuclear rubric

Only start this after the Codex final review loop is closed.

Dispatch a fresh-context, review-only `reviewer` subagent using
`prompts/final-review.md`.

Use:

- `rubrics/cursor-thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review.md`
- Review name: `Final thermo-nuclear full-worktree review`
- Scope: the entire final worktree after Codex-review fixes

The reviewer must focus on structural maintainability, abstraction quality,
codebase health, and code-judo simplifications without changing behavior.

### 6. Fix thermo-nuclear findings

If the thermo-nuclear reviewer reports actionable findings worth doing before
landing:

1. Synthesize accepted findings.
2. Dispatch `worker` using `prompts/fix-review-findings.md`.
3. Validate after fixes.
4. Re-run the thermo-nuclear final review until it passes or only explicitly
   deferred findings remain.

Do not use the thermo-nuclear pass as permission for broad unapproved rewrites.
Escalate scope or architecture changes to the human first.

### 7. Run final validation-readiness review

Only start this after the Codex and thermo-nuclear review loops are closed.
Refresh base SHA, current HEAD, `git status --short`, plan/spec paths, required
validation commands, and prior validation evidence.

Dispatch a fresh-context, review-only `reviewer` using
`prompts/final-validation-review.md`. The reviewer must run every feasible
required final command and treat any repository-fixable non-zero result as an
Important or Critical finding. Every base-to-head file is in scope, including
materialized plan/spec files and files created by earlier workflow commits.

Prior passing summaries are evidence only. They do not permit the reviewer to
skip commands. Landing is blocked until the reviewer returns `pass` or
`pass-with-deferred-minor-findings`.

### 8. Fix final validation findings

When the validation-readiness reviewer reports repository-fixable findings:

1. Synthesize the accepted validation findings with exact commands, concise
   output, and affected paths.
2. Dispatch `worker` using the skill's existing `fix-review-findings.md`
   contract (`prompts/fix-review-findings.md`).
3. Require focused fixes, appropriate validation, and a Conventional Commit.
4. Refresh HEAD, worktree status, and validation evidence.
5. Re-run the final validation-readiness review.

If validation is blocked by external tooling, infrastructure, credentials, or
operator action, return the existing blocked contract with evidence. Never
classify a branch-added failing file as out of scope merely because the
implementation worker did not edit it.

### 9. Complete landing and verify PR checks

After all three final review gates are closed:

1. Summarize implementation commits, passing validation, Codex review, thermo
   review, final validation-readiness review, and deferred findings.
2. Continue with the configured landing skill or Patchmill PR/direct-land
   instructions.
3. For direct landing, return `merged` only after the final validation-readiness
   review passed.
4. For PR fallback, create or update the pull request, then obtain its URL and
   current head SHA before returning final JSON.
5. Wait for all observable required PR checks using configured host tooling.
6. If all required checks pass, return the normal `pr-created` final JSON with
   only current passing validation evidence.
7. If test, lint, formatting, type-check, or build checks fail, collect failed
   check names, URLs, and failed-step logs. Dispatch `worker` using
   `prompts/fix-pr-checks.md`, then wait for replacement checks after its push.
8. Allow at most two PR-check repair passes. If code-related checks still fail,
   return the existing blocked contract with the remaining failures and links.
9. Treat cancelled, timed-out, infrastructure, permissions, quota, billing, or
   host-service failures as operator blockers. Do not dispatch a code-repair
   worker for them.

For GitHub, use `gh pr checks` and `gh run view --log-failed` or equivalent
supported commands. For Forgejo/Gitea, use the configured `tea` or API tooling.
If required checks cannot be observed, report that limitation rather than
claiming the PR is ready.

## Red flags

Never:

- Point Patchmill directly at `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` when
  this final-readiness workflow is required.
- Run the thermo-nuclear review before the Codex review loop is closed.
- Let a reviewer edit files during review-only passes.
- Treat one review pass as satisfying both rubrics.
- Review only the last task; final reviews cover the full final worktree.
- Skip re-review after fixes.
- Ignore uncommitted or untracked implementation changes.
- Proceed to landing with unresolved Critical or Important findings.
- Proceed to landing after a required validation command exits non-zero.
- Dismiss branch-added plan/spec or workflow artifacts as unchanged.
- Return `pr-created` before observable required checks finish.
- Dispatch code workers for infrastructure or operator failures.
- Run more than two PR-check repair passes.
- End the Patchmill turn while any subagent run remains unresolved.
- Use repeated status checks as a substitute for `wait` when no independent work
  remains.
- Return progress prose or promise to continue in a later turn.

## Dispatch shape reference

Review passes should use fresh context:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "reviewer",
  context: "fresh",
  task: "Use prompts/final-review.md with the selected rubric file and final scope below...",
  output: false,
});
```

Final validation uses fresh reviewer context:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "reviewer",
  context: "fresh",
  task: "Use prompts/final-validation-review.md with the final scope and required commands below...",
  output: false,
});
```

Fix passes should use the normal implementation worker:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Use prompts/fix-review-findings.md for accepted review or validation findings below...",
});
```

PR-check repair uses the normal worker context:

```typescript
subagent({
  agent: "worker",
  task: "Use prompts/fix-pr-checks.md for failed check evidence below...",
});
```
